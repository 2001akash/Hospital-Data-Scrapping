1. Introduction

Objective: The purpose of this project is to develop a text classification model that can categorize hospital-related data into predefined labels.

Data Source:Data was loaded from `cleaned_hospital_data.csv`, which contains text data and was used for training and evaluating the model.

2. Data Loading

File Loaded:`cleaned_hospital_data.csv`

Columns in DataFrame:
- `url`
- `data`

3.Preprocessing

Preprocessing Details:
- Columns Used: Only the `data` column was utilized due to the lack of specific labels in the dataset. Dummy labels were used for model training.
- Vectorization: Text data was transformed into numerical features using `TfidfVectorizer`.

4. Model Training

Algorithm Used:`MultinomialNB` (Naive Bayes)

Training Process:
- The model was trained on the preprocessed data with a training accuracy of 1.0000.

5. Model Evaluation

Model Performance:

- Accuracy: 1.0000
- Classification Report:
  ```
                precision    recall  f1-score   support

    dummy_label       1.00      1.00      1.00         9

      accuracy                           1.00         9
     macro avg       1.00      1.00      1.00         9
  weighted avg       1.00      1.00      1.00         9
  ```

6.Model Saving

Files Created:
- Model: `model.pkl`
- Vectorizer: `vectorizer.pkl`

Output: Both the trained model and vectorizer have been saved successfully.
